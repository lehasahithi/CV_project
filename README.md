**🧠 AI-Based Gait Analysis for Stroke Survivors and Physically Disabled Individuals**
This project leverages computer vision techniques to analyze and assess human gait patterns for stroke survivors and individuals with physical disabilities. Using pose estimation frameworks like OpenPose and MediaPipe, the system extracts key joint coordinates from video footage to detect abnormalities in walking patterns.

**🏥 Objective**
To develop a software-based solution that enables remote gait assessment, supports physical rehabilitation monitoring, and helps medical professionals track patient progress over time.

**🔍 Key Features**
**Pose Estimation**: Real-time extraction of skeletal joint data using OpenPose/MediaPipe.

**Gait Feature Extraction**: Measurement of stride length, cadence, joint angles, and symmetry.

**Anomaly Detection**: Identification of irregular gait patterns indicating physical impairment.

**Comparative Analysis**: Visualization and comparison against standard gait profiles.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive dashboard for healthcare professionals or caregivers.

**📁 Dataset**
Utilized publicly available gait datasets like CASIA-B for benchmarking.

Includes synthesized or recorded gait videos for custom analysis (if applicable).
